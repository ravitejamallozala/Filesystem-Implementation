# Filesystem-Implementation
Instagram clone: Files can be uploaded and comments can be added to any of the file .
 purpose: 
      managing pictures(uploading &amp; downloading) along with their comments given by other users.
      The data will be stored as user specific data , so we can track the user progress and getdata as per user.
Basic Information:
      developed using C  capacity: 100mb(expandable to even GBs of data).
      meta data is used to keep tract of all the data which is stored in the file, file has been divided into blocks each of 128 bytes wach and also 2048 bytes for later blocks to store uploaded file data. Command line UI is used for uploading, downloading, adding comments to the files, logging in or signing up of the user.
       
Other Information about implementation:
      FIle size --> 104857600 ->100MB
      BLOCK SIZE 128 bytes
      FILE BLOCK SIZE 2048
      Master block 1 block
      Bit vector 1280 blocks 128 * 1280 = 163,840 bytes
      Users data 1281 block num to 7sb complete next start from 1297th block

      Meta message 1297 block no start total 8192 + 8192 blocks reserved
      Message data 17681 block no start total 8192 + 8192 blocks reserved
      
      File metadata 34065 block no start total	
      // 128 -> 2kb(2048bytes) block size // total 7082 blocks leaving 112 bytes atlast
      

optimizations: 
      Bit-vector implementation for effective use of memory.User can upload, download and can delete the data also he can keep track of comments made by other users.
